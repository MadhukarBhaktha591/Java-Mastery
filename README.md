# # Java-Mastery 🚀

Welcome to the Java-Mastery repository! This repository is a labor of love as I embark on a coding journey, following along with a Udemy tutor, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

## What's Inside 📦
This repository contains code, notes, and projects related to my Java programming learning journey. Each commit message is tagged with the corresponding section and video from the course. For example, a commit message like "02-09 Constructor" indicates that the code in that commit corresponds to Section 02, Video 09 of the course where we discussed constructors.

## Why This Repository? 🤔
I created this repository to document my learning process and to keep track of my progress. By sharing it with the world, I hope to inspire others to learn Java programming and showcase the value of continuous learning.
